        <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>\
            <li>2 teaspoon granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups warm water</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white vinegar</li>
            <li>3 3/4 - 4 cups bread flour (all-purpose flour would also work)</li>
            <p><strong>Toppings:</strong></p>
            <li>1 cup pizza sauce homemade or good quality store-bought</li>
            <li>2 cups pepperoni</li>
            <li>4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon italian seasoning</li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Making your own Pizza Dough:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Combine: </strong>In a large bowl of a stand mixer combine Â½ cup of the warm water with the sugar and yeast.
                 Stir to dissolve the yeast and let rest for 5 minutes. It should foam on the top. Add the remaining 
                 1 cup of warm water, olive oil, salt and vinegar.</li>
            <li><strong>Knead Dough: </strong>Begin mixing on medium-low speed, gradually adding the flour a cup at a time, and knead the dough for about 7 minutes, or until it's smooth and elastic. 
                You may not need all of the flour. The dough should be slightly sticky, but not so sticky that it really sticks to your fingertip when touched.</li>
            <li><strong>Rise: </strong>Transfer dough to a greased bowl and cover with a dry towel or greased plastic wrap. Allow to rise for 1 to 1.5 hours, or until it has about doubled in volume.</li>
            <li><strong>Roll out: </strong>Gently punch the dough down and place on a lightly greased or floured counter top. Divide dough into 2 or 3 equal pieces (makes about two 14'' or three 9'' pizzas). 
                Roll and stretch the dough to desired size and thickness. Brush dough with olive oil.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Cook Pepperoni Pizza:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Oven Method: </strong>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (with a pizza stone inside, if you have one). If using a pizza stone, add cornmeal and flour to a pizza peel or parchment paper and 
                place pizza dough on top (otherwise press the dough into a pizza pan). Prick the top of the dough a few times with a fork and pre-bake the dough in the pizza pan, or slide onto a hot pizza stone 
                to pre-bake for 3-4 minutes. Remove from oven and add pizza sauce and toppings. Return to oven and bake for 5-12 more minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
            <li><strong>Grill Method: </strong>Preheat grill to medium-high. Roll out dough and place on a piece of parchment paper. Spread with oil, then gently flip the pizza onto the grill, oil side down, 
                and peel the parchment paper off. Cover grill lid and cook for 2-3 or until grill marks form on bottom. Flip the pizzas onto a plate and add sauce and pepperoni pizza toppings to cooked side.
                 Reduce heat and slide pizzas back on grill to cook another 3-5 minutes</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Notes/Alterations to the recipe</h2>
        <p><strong>Yield: </strong>Makes two large 14" pizzas, or three 8" pizzas</p>
        <p><strong>Pizza Dough: </strong>If you'd like to skip the homemade dough and use
         store-bought, buy 2 lbs of dough for this recipe. Trader Joes, Sam's Club, or 
        Winco's bakery fresh pizza doughs recommended</p>
        <p><strong>Toppings: </strong>The topping amounts are to cover two large pizzas</p>
        <p><Strong>To make Ahead: </Strong>Make the dough up until the first rise. Place the dough in an airtight container in the fridge to rise overnight, or for several hours, before rolling it out and pre-baking it.
             Or you can completely make the pizza dough, including pre-baking it in the oven for 6 minutes. Top with desired pizza toppings, cover well with plastic wrap and refrigerate for several hours, until ready to 
             bake your pizza.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Freezing instructions: </strong>Form a ball with the dough and lightly spray it on all sides. Wrap it in plastic wrap and place it in a freezer safe bag in the freezer for up to 3 months. To thaw, 
            place the pizza dough in the refrigerator overnight to thaw and rise, then roll it out when you are ready to pre-bake. You could also pre-bake the pizza crust and freeze the pre-baked crust before adding sauce 
            and toppings. Just make sure the crust cools completely, then wrap it in plastic wrap and tinfoil and store it in your freezer.</p>

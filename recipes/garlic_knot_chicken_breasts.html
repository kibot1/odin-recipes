        <h3>This recipe is super simple to make and only requires five ingredients (
            aside from the oil, salt, and pepper) to pull it all together.</h3>

        <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
            <li>4 chicken cutlets (about 1 1/2 pounds)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>4 large cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup packed fresh parsley leaves and tender stems, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1/4 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 lemon, cut into wedges (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cook the chicken: </strong></li>
            <p>Heat the oil and 2 tablespoons of the butter ]
                in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Pat the chicken dry and season all over 
                with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. 
                Add the chicken to the skillet and cook until golden brown on both sides and registers
                 165Â°F in the thickest part, about 3 minutes per side. Remove the skillet from heat and 
                 transfer the chicken to a plate; set aside.</p>
            <li><strong>Make the garlic-butter sauce: </strong></li>
            <p>Off the heat, add the remaining butter and 
                stir until melted. Add the garlic and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.</p>
            <li><strong>Add the chicken and serve: </strong></li>
            <p>Place the skillet back over medium heat and return the chicken to the skillet along with any juices. 
                Add half of the parsley and turn to coat; season to taste with salt and pepper. 
            Serve garlic knot chicken topped with the Parmesan and remaining parsley. Provide lemon wedges on the side
             for squeezing over, if desired. Leftover chicken can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for 
             up to 4 days.</p>   
        </ol>
